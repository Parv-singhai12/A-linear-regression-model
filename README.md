Title: House Price Prediction Model

Description:

This Python project implements a linear regression model to predict house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms. The model is trained on a dataset of house sales data and can be used to estimate the price of a new house given its features.


Usage:

Prepare your data:

Ensure your data is in a CSV format with columns named square_footage, number_of_bedrooms, number_of_bathrooms, and price.

Save the data as data.csv in the project directory.


Train the model:

Python

python train_model.py


This will train the linear regression model and save the trained model as model.pkl.


Make predictions:

Python

python predict_price.py


Enter the square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms of the house you want to predict the price for. The model will output the predicted price.

Dependencies:


pandas

numpy

scikit-learn

matplotlib (for visualization)



Model Details:

Features: square_footage, number_of_bedrooms, number_of_bathrooms

Target variable: price

Algorithm: Linear regression

Evaluation metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared



Improvements:

Data preprocessing: Consider handling missing values, outliers, and feature scaling for better model performance.

Feature engineering: Explore creating additional features (e.g., location, age of the house, proximity to amenities) that might improve predictive power.

Regularization: Experiment with regularization techniques (L1 or L2) to prevent overfitting, especially if you have a large number of features.

Hyperparameter tuning: Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, regularization strength) to optimize performance.

Ensemble methods: Consider using ensemble techniques like random forest or gradient boosting for potentially better results.
